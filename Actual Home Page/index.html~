			<p> As we think about the poor, the abused, the helpless, what can our compassion accomplish for them?

			<br>A lot. No individual can solve the world's needs. Although, perhaps we could do something. People helping people, communities helping communities; delivering energy and resource impacting the lives of the poor.

			<br>And that's what we did! We created a website to try and make a change.

			<br>Help Treat The Poor is an online donation and request service to help the less fortuate
